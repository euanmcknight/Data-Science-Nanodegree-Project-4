# Project Title: Dog and Human Image Classification

https://medium.com/@euan.mcknight/can-a-machine-really-identify-a-dog-breed-f44e31565049

## Project Overview
This project develops an image classification algorithm to identify whether an image contains a human, a dog, or neither. It further classifies the breed of the dog or determines the dog breed a human resembles.

## Motivation
This project aims to create an efficient and accurate image classification system that could be used in various applications, such as social media, surveillance, and personal photo organization.
